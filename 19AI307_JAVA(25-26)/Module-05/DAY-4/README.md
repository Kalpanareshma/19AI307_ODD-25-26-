# Ex.No:5(D) THREAD PRIORITY

## QUESTION:
Write a Java program to determine the priority and name of the current thread.
Note: Read the thread name from the user.

## AIM:
To write a Java program that sets and retrieves the name and priority of the current thread using Thread class methods.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Start the program.

2. Import the necessary package java.util.

3. Read the thread name from the user.

4. Get the current thread using Thread.currentThread().

5. Set the thread name with setName().

6. Retrieve thread priority using getPriority().

7. Display priority, name, and full thread details.

8. End the program.



## PROGRAM:

        String name = sc.nextLine();
        sc.close();

        Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
        t.setName(name);

        System.out.println("Priority of Thread: " + t.getPriority());
        System.out.println("Name of Thread: " + t.getName());
        System.out.println(t);
    }
}
```
